I"4<p>As a part of an elective course on Musicotherapy I developed with my team a research on the effects of binaural audio. We had the opportunity to present our results at <a href="https://www.sim.spk-berlin.de/program_1511.html">CIM14 (a conference on Interdisciplinary Musicology)</a>. in Berlin. During this project I had my first contact with the experimental and research methods of science. Itâ€™s also important to mention that the technology we used for the EEG measurments was pretty limited (<a href="https://store.neurosky.com/">Mindwave Neurosky</a>), but the research constituted an important effort towards preparing a serious scientific paper.</p>

<p>Below is a picture of the <a href="https://cycling74.com/">Max</a> patch I developed for retrieving the signals from the Mindwave EEG device.</p>
