I"á<p>During the class of Music and psychoacoustics I studied with my team the impact of melodic components in memory. For this purpose we conducted two experiments: The first one consisted in studying the effects of the melodyâ€™s presence in the short term memory by means of sequences of sung and spoken letters. The second used two groups of sung melodies (structured and chaotic) to study how melodic and rhythmic features impact memorization. Both experiments were carried out with students between 12 and 16 years old. The following video explains the results and methodology in detail.</p>
