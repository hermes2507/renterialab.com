I"C<p>During the NOVUS 2015 project, I had the opportunity to work with an interdisciplinary team on the development of a Brain-Computer Interface. This consisted in controlling a<a href="https://inmoov.fr/">3D printed arm</a> via servo motors to play the piano. The team was made up by students from Systems Engineering, Mechatronics and Music Production Engineering.</p>

<p>NOTE: The robotic arm yet canâ€™t move horizontally across the keyboard. Finger movement is achieved via facial gestures. We look forward implementing more control gestures for extending expressivity.</p>
