<p>Key issues:</p>

<ul>
  <li>How the relationship between the artist and the machine has changed artistic expression?</li>
  <li>How machines can become a new kind of medium?</li>
  <li>Can machines enhance aesthetic awareness?</li>
</ul>

<p>During a workshop at Centro Nacional de las Artes, Jos√© Manuel Ruiz invited us to reflect on these questions by exploring the concept of media, theoretically and experimentally by developing an artwork with the machines at the media lab.</p>

<p>After playing with the photocopier I realized I could use it as a medium for expressing the ‚Äútransduction of the primitive‚Äù. A human process of symbollic exploration that began with the first handprint in a cave, and continued through time with the use of technology: automatic reproduction, replication and transformation of symbols. Below are the results.</p>

<ul>
  <li>How do we inhabit and talk through the media?</li>
  <li>What marks do media leave on us?</li>
</ul>
