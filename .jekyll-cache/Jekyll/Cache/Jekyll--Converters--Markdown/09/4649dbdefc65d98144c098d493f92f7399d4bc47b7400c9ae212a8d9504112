I"¿<p>As a part of the call for experimentation in education innovation: NOVUS 2015, I received funding for giving a course of three modules about Machine Learning applied to digital arts. We explored the philosophical implications of AI in art, and the technical aspects for applying Machine Learning in Music and Interactive Art. The funding was used for buying various interfaces (Myo, Leap Motion, Kinect and Arduino) and Emotiv EEG sensors.</p>
