I"à<p>Spacetime, a multidisciplinary architecture and design agency, invited me to collaborate at BahidorÃ¡ Festival with two art installations.</p>

<p>The first one, named Colormancy, involed the interplay between code, divination and chance. By mapping peoplesâ€™ names to particular colors custom ambiences were created out of light and smoke. Eventually a quote based on song lyrics fragments was shown as a personal fortune in a screen. A Raspberry Pi and a touchscreen were used for controlling the whole interaction: receiveing usersâ€™ input, automating multicolor LEDs and smoke machines via DMX and electronic relays.</p>

<p>The second installation used no electronics but played with basic shapes (lines and points) translated in space and time.</p>
