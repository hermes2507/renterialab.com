<p>This work is under development. One of the objectives is reflecting on the psychological effects of the noise in Mexico city. Up to date we have a Max application that distorts video by using the audio signal. In this way acoustic noise is translated into a visual experience. Stay tuned. I want to take this idea to an augmented reality platform.</p>
