_"The artist can decide either to dominate the machine or give it the ability to talk in his language"._

Key issues:

* How the relationship between the artist and the machine has changed artistic expression?
* How machines can become a new kind of medium?
* Can machines enhance aesthetic awareness?

During a workshop at <a href="http://cmm.cenart.gob.mx/">Centro Nacional de las Artes</a>, <a href="http://josemanuelruiz.net/">Jos√© Manuel Ruiz</a> invited us to reflect on these questions by exploring the concept of media, theoretically and experimentally by developing an artwork with the machines at the media lab.

After playing with the photocopier I realized I could use it as a medium for expressing the "transduction of the primitive".

Below are the results.

* How do we inhabit and talk through the media?
* What marks do media leave on us?
