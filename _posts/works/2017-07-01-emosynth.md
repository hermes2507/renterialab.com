During a Music technology hackaton (a 6 hour programming contest) I developed with two friends a Pure Data program for sonifying emotions through facial expressions. For this purpose we used <a href="https://www.affectiva.com/">Affectiva</a>., a facial recognition API driven by Machine Learning. For more information please watch the video. And don't forget turning on english subtitles. You can get the code <a href="https://github.com/hermes2507/EmoSynth">here</a>.

We got 1st place and won an Arturia MiniBrute Analog Synthesizer
