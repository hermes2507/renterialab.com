During the class of Music and psychoacoustics I studied with my team the impact of melodic components in memory. For this purpose we conducted two experiments: The first one consisted in studying the effects of melody in short term memory by evaluating the recall of sung and spoken letter sequences. The second used two groups of sung melodies (structured and chaotic) to study how the regularity of melodic and rhythmic features impacts memorization. Both experiments were carried out with students between 12 and 16 years old. The following video explains the results and methodology in detail.
